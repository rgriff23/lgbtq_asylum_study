Another moment, there are a lot of international LGBTQI organization talk about protecting human rights and assistance to LGBTQI people, but they often refuse any help for LGBTQI immigrants. It is just their PR and double standards. If you don't have the social network and good American friends it is complicated to survive in this country, impossible. I think I am lucky because I met with a wonderful lesbian couple who became my very close friends. But the most LGBTQI immigrants have to face with acceptance, closure, isolation even in the American LGBT community. Besides it, I am lucky living in New York. There are different social programs for LGBTQI immigrants and also the unique medical center for intersex and transgender people. But I know that New York is an exception. 
And even as an immigrant, I have the privileges that help me to survive in the USA. Yes, I am intersex, but I take hormones, and I look like as a man, so I don't have problems with discrimination transgender or gender nonbinary people. And I am not Muslim, and I am white. When I start living in this country, I discovered that all these moments are privileges.
